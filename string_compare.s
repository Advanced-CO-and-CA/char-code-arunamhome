/*Compare two strings of ASCII characters to see which is larger (i.e., which follows  the  other  in  alphabetical  ordering).  
Both  strings  have  the  same length as deNined by the LENGTH variable. 
The stringsâ€™ starting addresses are defined by the START1 and START2 variables. 
If the string defined by START1  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  other  string,  clear  the  GREATER variable; 
otherwise set the variable to all ones (0xFFFFFFFF).
